PeekIgnore = {}

--[[

	[ Instructions ]

   If you want to block a particular Peek element, you need only add
   a line to this file.

   The line should be added in the following format:

   PeekIgnore.word = true

   For example, if you wished reputation chcecks to be ignored, then
   you would use:

   PeekIgnore.reputation = true

   If you wished to stop the andbank item queries from going through,
   you'd use:

   PeekIgnore.andbank = true
   
   This is true for every Peek item.  Just add your lines directly
   after 'Insert Entries Here'.
